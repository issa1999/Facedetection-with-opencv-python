# Facedetection-with-opencv-python
I am working ondrive safe project , the main idea of this project is to create a program that detects the driver emotions and status while driving and give him an alert if he is angry , tired ... to avoid accidents and other issues 
the project is mainly devided in two parts :
I- the first part is to create an algorithm that detects the driver's face and his emotion using tensorflow and openCV libraries 
II- the second part is to create a mobile application using android studio to implement this algorithm and give the alarm for the driver 
currently the project is in progress i am publishing the code in parts everytime i make some updates 
feel free to contribute , update , and to propose someother modifications
